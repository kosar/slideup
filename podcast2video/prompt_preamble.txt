always preface running podcast-to-video.py or any shell script that calls it with 2 important 'source' steps: 1. source the api keys from the parent folder (the slideup folder) under the file name .keys_donotcheckin.env; 2. source the python virtual env venv named podcast_env that sits in the podcast2video folder. If you are making changes based on problems you are trying to solve: BE SURE to use the limit_to_one_minute flag which will use a minimal set of samples to fully exercise the entire codebase. Once you solve the problem, run the program one last time without the limit_to_one_minute flag, to be sure that it processes the entire input file. 

Examine the terminal output and check for warnings or errors. 

If you are running the shell script, be sure to run it with the command: ./run_podcast2video.sh

If you are running the python script directly, be sure to run it with the command: python podcast-to-video.py
